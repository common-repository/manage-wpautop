== Description ==

Wordpress provide [wpautop](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wpautop "wpautop") filter to replcae all double line break with 'p' tag and single line break with 'br' tag. Which is very useful to us. But sometimes this also causes some issues e.g. it can break the whole html structure of your post content, which is unwanted.

We can also disable the [wpautop](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wpautop "wpautop") filter by removing it from 'the_content' and 'the_excerpt'. But it will remove wpautop for all of your posts, pages, and custom post types.

But, sometimes you want to remove it only for specific posts. So, what can you do in this situation? Don't worry. You can perform this type of works with this plugin.

This Plugin let you enable or disable [wpautop](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wpautop "wpautop") for your specifc posts, pages or custom posts. You can choose which posts need to disable wpautop. It doesn't impact on your other posts.
